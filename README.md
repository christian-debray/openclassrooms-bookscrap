# openclassrooms-bookscrap
Openclassrooms python course - project 2 - scraping tool

(work in progress...)

So far, we can read the data form one book.
For the moment, book URL is hard-coded in scrapebooks.py

## Usage
once all packages and dependencies have been installed in a vritual environment:

    `$ python scrapebooks.py`

For now, we just output a dict with the data found on the book's product page.
